The modern carbon isotope signature of preindustrial water masses in the western subpolar North Atlantic

In recent years the question of how ocean circulation will change with climate
change has risen due to the changing climate system and with that interactions
between the ocean and the atmorphere. One important region is the western subpolar
North Atlantic where deep Labrador Sea Water is formed, which is a crucial
component of the Deep Western Boundary Current.


Nevertheless, Labrador Sea
Water does not form every year and the circumstances when it forms are not
entirely understood. With temperature, salinity and oxygen data from the survey
of the Maria S Merian (MSM39) it could be established that during the winter of
2013/2014 deep Labrador Sea Water was not formed but the western subpolar
North Atlantic was preconditioned for the formation the following years. The distribution
of water masses during MSM39 gives us an idea about the composition of
δ13C, measured from samples taken during MSM39, for each water mass, which
is used as a framework to compare to paleo δ13C ocean distribution. However, today
the natural δ13C composition is strongly overprinted by anthropogenic carbon
dioxide. This so called C-Suess Effect has to be corrected for the modern ocean
δ13C distribution during MSM39. Two methods were used to reach the preindustrial
δ13C. The first is the two-stage-back calcutlation already applied by Olsen and
Ninnemann (2010) that useses the relationship between CFC-12 and δ13C. The
second method was established by Eide et al. (2017) and shows a linear relation
between AOU and the preindustrial δ13C that was applied to the obserevd oxygen
from MSM39. Both methods come to a similar preindustrial ocean distribution of
δ13C with an ocean structure that shows a tongue of high δ13C showing the lighter
Labrador Sea Water and a Suess effect that affects the entire water column.
